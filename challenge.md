## Challenge Guidelines

As part of the benchmarking effort, we are hosting a competition and offering prizes for the best-performing submissions on the EvalAI leaderboard. The challenge deadline is **XXX**. The challenge is hosted on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2319/overview).

### Ranking and Prizes

### Eligibility

To be considered for challenge prizes, teams must submit their methods to the EvalAI challenge before the deadline *and* commit to releasing training code for reproducibility. (There is no commitment to release training data.) Code must be open-sourced before we transfer funds.

We recommend participants to publicly share their code to help promote progress in the field.
