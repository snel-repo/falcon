    H1 contains open-loop calibration data collected in one human participant for a reach and grasp BCI experiment.  The participant watches a virtual arm perform a series of movements and attempts to match these movements. The participant cannot execute these movements fully due to high level spinal cord injury. The virtual arm behavior is phasic and pre-specified, such that movement is restricted to one primary degree of freedom is changed at a time, rather than freeform. Neural activity is collected from Utah arrays implanted in the arm and hand areas of motor cortex. This data is provided by Sharlene Flesher and Jen Collinger at University of Pittsburgh.

    **Why H1?** Motor population activity represent a breadth of movement variables that are accessible through linear decoding. This richness has been used in microelectrode-based BCIs to enable high-dimensional arm and hand control was demonstrated over a decade ago, and this signal quality has been a hallmark motivation for microelectrode-based BCIs. Nonetheless, two challenges remain:

    - High dimensional control remains a burden to calibrate, with this particular experimental protocol demanding several minutes of calibration.
    - The identified decoders do not provide stable control, such that experimenters routinely prepare new decoders in each experimental session despite the burden.

    Providing methods to improve the efficiency of calibration in novel sessions would thus greatly improve the practical viability of high dimensional neuroprosthetic motor control from spikes.

    The random target task is a self-paced, sequential reaching task between random elements of a grid. The dataset includes neural spiking data from the primary cortex along with simultaneously recorded monkey finger position, cursor position, and target position.


    The unique task design results in the absence of pre-movement delay periods and repeated, highly constrained reach  conditions typical of other reaching tasks. The ability to accurately model motor cortical activity during this more naturalistic behavior, and not only highly-stereotyped reaches with preparatory periods, is vital to developing effective BCI decoders and understanding the functioning of the motor cortex.

    The bump task resembles a standard center-out reaching task, but on a portion of the trials, the monkey's arm was bumped before the reach. Neural activity was recorded from Brodmann’s area 2 of the somatosensory cortex, and the dataset also includes position, velocity, and acceleration of the monkey’s hand, force between the monkey’s hand and the manipulandum, and monkey muscle length & velocity and joint angle & velocity.


    Area 2 is robustly driven by mechanical perturbations to the arm and has been shown to contain information about whole-arm kinematics. Thus, this dataset provides the challenge of modeling input-driven activity in response to both predictable and unpredictable sensory feedback, in contrast to the largely autonomous dynamics of the motor cortex during reaching tasks.

    The ready-set-go task is a cognitive timing task in which the subject is presented with two stimuli (Ready followed by Set) separated by a certain time interval. The subject then attempts to perform an action (Go) such that the interval between Set and Go matches the interval between Ready and Set. Neural activity was recorded from the dorsomedial frontal cortex, which is associated with higher-level functions like motor control and timing.


    Unlike the motor cortex or somatosensory cortex, which are primarily driven by either internal dynamics or inputs, activity in the DMFC is strongly dependent on both and is involved in complex tasks that do not have clear moment-by-moment external behavioral correlates. As a result, the DMFC_RSG dataset presents unique challenges in both modeling this complex activity and evaluating the resulting predictions.
